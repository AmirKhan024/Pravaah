## 2026-09-25 — Phase 1: one shared function instead of two copy-fixes

**Decision:** when the Nerul-skywalk-throughput bug turned out to be two independent implementations
of the same calculation (`lib/facts.ts` and `engine/ablation.ts`) that had quietly drifted apart,
the fix was to extract one shared, exported, tested engine function (`peakPulseBurst()` in
`engine/arrivals.ts`) rather than just correcting the wrong hardcoded string in `engine/ablation.ts`.

**Why:** correcting the string alone would have fixed today's symptom but left the underlying
condition — two places computing the same real-world fact independently — in place, free to drift
again the next time either file is edited without the other. `SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md` §3 exists
precisely to prevent this class of bug for LLM-produced numbers; the same principle applies to any
number that appears in more than one place in the app, LLM-produced or not. One function, one test
pinning its actual output against this scenario's real data, used everywhere the figure appears.

**Alternative considered:** leave `lib/facts.ts`'s version as the "real" one and have
`engine/ablation.ts` just read a passed-in value instead of computing its own. Rejected because
`engine/` must stay framework-free and self-contained (§14.3) — it shouldn't depend on `lib/`
computing something for it and handing it down; the computation itself belongs in `engine/`, and
`lib/facts.ts` (which is allowed to import from `@/engine`) should be the consumer, not the source.
This is also why the function lives in `engine/arrivals.ts` next to `arrivalCurve()`, which it's
built directly on top of, rather than in a new top-level file.
